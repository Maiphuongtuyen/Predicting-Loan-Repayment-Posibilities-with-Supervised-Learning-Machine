# Predicting-Loan-Repayment-Posibilities-with-Supervised-Learning-Machine

### Credit scoring methods have been utilized to assess borrower creditworthiness. However, these methods often rely on a limited set of factors, potentially overlooking crucial aspects that influence loan performance. This can lead to inaccurate assessments and increase the risk of defaults for lenders. Therefore, in this study, i used supervised model to predict borrowers' repayment ability at Lending Club, and evaluate the best-performing model on the dataset. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was also conducted to understand the dataset’s characteristics

### About dataset
LendingClub is the leading digital marketplace bank in the U.S., connecting borrowers with investors since 2007. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market.

The data provided by LendingClub includes detailed records of loan applications, borrower profiles, loan terms, credit scores, employment information, and loan performance metrics. The dataset extracted from LendingClub.com spans from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018.

In this study, i will implement 5 supervised machine learning models such as: Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Logistic Regression Classifier, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting Classifier to predict the customer loan repayment  and then assess which model performs best on the dataset. The figure below is a part of the dataset after removing the less important variables. However, to be able to run the predictive model, it’s necessary to remove additional variables to reduce noise in the model. I have noted these steps in my Python code.
